# Getting started

## Intro

- explain SG API, SG REST API, and the sgtk API

## Generating a path and publishing it

This guide covers getting started with the sgtk (Shotgun Toolkit) Python API, 
which is what our pipeline integrations are built with.

The purpose of this guide is to walk through a basic example of how you can use the API, and 
by the env, you will be able to import the sgtk API and generate a path and publish it.

### Requirements

- An understanding of Python programing fundamentals. 
- A project with an advanced configuration. If you haven't setup a configuration before you can follow the ["Getting started with configurations"](need link) guide.

### Steps

1. [Importing sgtk](./developer-guides/part-1-importing-sgtk.md)
2. [Getting an Sgtk instance](./developer-guides/part-2-getting-sgtk-instance.md)
3. [Getting context](./developer-guides/part-3-getting-context.md)
4. [Creating folders](./developer-guides/part-4-creating-folders.md)
5. [Using a template to build a path](./developer-guides/part-5-build-a-path.md)
6. [Finding existing files and getting the latest version number](./developer-guides/part-6-find-latest-version.md)
7. [Registering a published file](./developer-guides/part-7-registering-publish.md)
8. [Pulling it all together into a complete script](./developer-guides/part-8-getting-started-complete-script.md)
