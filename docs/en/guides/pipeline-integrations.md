# Pipeline Integrations

Shotgun's pipeline integrations bring Shotgun data to your artists. Customizable UIs within popular content creation software give artists out-of-the-box tools to view information about their tasks, read and add notes, and share files with teammates. Pipeline integrations are build on the Shotgun Toolkit platform, and developers can use the Toolkit API to extend functionality or create custom Toolkit apps. 

This section contains learning materials to help you get started as you administer a Shotgun pipeline. You'll find guides to configuring your pipeline and managing your production file system, a tutorial for building a basic vfx pipeline, and resources for writing your own pipeline tools.
