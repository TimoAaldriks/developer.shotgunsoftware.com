# Development

You can extend our the pipeline tools that Shotgun offers to meet your studio's needs via custom code development. Our pipeline apps are designed with hooks that make it easy to add custom logic to existing process, and you can go further by writing your own apps that use our frameworks for UI elements and Shotgun integration, or writing your own engines, bringing the Shotgun pipeline integrations into new content creation software. 

This section contains information about developing custom code to work with the Shotgun pipeline integrations.
